Here is a list of engineering tasks necessary to implement the user stories for your MVP GreenNet:

**User Story 1: Create Account and Log In**

1. Design and implement a secure user authentication system using a library such as OAuth or Okta.
2. Create a registration form with fields for username, password, and any other required information.
3. Implement password hashing and salting to store user passwords securely.
4. Develop a login form that accepts username and password input.
5. Implement login logic to verify user credentials and redirect to the dashboard upon successful login.
6. Design and implement a dashboard page that displays user information and device data.

**User Story 2: Add and Manage Devices**

1. Design and implement a device data model to store device information (name, type, location, etc.).
2. Create a device registration form with fields for required information.
3. Develop a device management API to add, edit, and delete devices.
4. Implement device data storage in the database, linked to the user's account.
5. Design and implement a dashboard page that displays a list of all user devices.
6. Develop edit and delete functionality for devices on the dashboard.

**User Story 3: Real-time Energy Data**

1. Design and implement a data ingestion pipeline to collect real-time energy data from devices.
2. Develop a data processing system to clean, transform, and store energy data in the database.
3. Create a data visualization component to display real-time energy data in a user-friendly format (charts, graphs).
4. Implement filtering and sorting functionality for energy data by device, date, or other criteria.
5. Develop a system to update energy data in real-time, reflecting the current energy usage of each device.

**User Story 4: Notifications and Alerts**

1. Design and implement a notification system to send alerts when energy consumption or production exceeds custom thresholds.
2. Develop a threshold setting API to allow users to customize notification settings for each device.
3. Implement email and in-app notification functionality to send alerts to users.
4. Create a notification management system to track and store notification history.
5. Develop a system to trigger notifications when energy data exceeds custom thresholds.

**User Story 5: Energy Usage Statistics**

1. Design and implement a data aggregation system to calculate overall energy usage and production statistics.
2. Develop a data visualization component to display statistics in a user-friendly format (charts, graphs).
3. Implement filtering and sorting functionality for statistics by date, device, or other criteria.
4. Create a system to update statistics in real-time, reflecting the user's overall energy usage.
5. Develop a dashboard page to display overall energy usage and production statistics.

**Additional Tasks**

1. Implement user authentication and authorization to restrict access to user data.
2. Develop a database schema to store user, device, and energy data.
3. Implement data encryption and security measures to protect user data.
4. Develop a testing framework to ensure the system meets the acceptance criteria.
5. Conduct performance and scalability testing to ensure the system can handle a large number of users and devices.

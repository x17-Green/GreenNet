- **Device profiling**: Create profiles for each device to monitor its behavior and detect anomalies.
- **Anomaly detection**: Use machine learning algorithms to identify unusual device behavior that may indicate a security threat.

###### 5. Implement Access Control

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive areas of the system. This includes:

- **Role definition**: Define roles for users and devices, and assign permissions accordingly.
- **Access control lists**: Use access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to specific resources and data.

###### 6. Regularly Update and Patch Systems

Regularly update and patch systems to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

###### 7. Implement Incident Response and Disaster Recovery Plans

Develop incident response and disaster recovery plans to respond to security incidents and ensure business continuity.

###### 8. Conduct Regular Security Audits and Testing

Conduct regular security audits and testing to identify vulnerabilities and ensure the effectiveness of security measures.

> Here's an example of how you could implement secure authentication using OAuth 2.0 in Python:
```
import requests

# OAuth 2.0 client credentials
client_id = "your_client_id"
client_secret = "your_client_secret"

# User credentials
username = "your_username"
password = "your_password"

# Authenticate using OAuth 2.0
auth_url = "https://your_auth_server.com/oauth/token"
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}
data = {
    "grant_type": "password",
    "username": username,
    "password": password,
    "client_id": client_id,
    "client_secret": client_secret
}
response = requests.post(auth_url, headers=headers, data=data)

# Get access token
access_token = response.json()["access_token"]

# Use access token to authenticate requests
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"}
response = requests.get("https://your_energy_management_system.com/api/data", headers=headers)
```

Remember to replace the placeholders with your actual client credentials, user credentials, and API endpoints.

	*Note that this is a simplified pseudo code and I might need to modify and extend it based on the specific requirements of my project.*
	
	This is just one possible way to design the database schema, and you may need to modify it based on the specific requirements of your application.
	
	Also, you will need to consider the following:
	
	- How to optimize the database schema for performance and scalability
	- How to implement data backup and recovery procedures
	- How to ensure data security and access control
	
	###### **Here is a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this task using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
	
	**Step 1: Design the database schema**
		*Using MySQL, design the relational database schema to store user information, device data, and notification settings. The schema should include the tables and relationships mentioned in the task description.*
	
	**Step 2: Create a Python class for each table**
		*Create a Python class for each table in the database schema. For example:*
	```
		class User:
		    def __init__(self, id, username, password, email):
		        self.id = id
		        self.username = username
		        self.password = password
		        self.email = email
		
		class Device:
		    def __init__(self, id, name, type, location):
		        self.id = id
		        self.name = name
		        self.type = type
		        self.location = location
		
		class DeviceData:
		    def __init__(self, id, device_id, timestamp, energy_consumption, energy_production):
		        self.id = id
		        self.device_id = device_id
		        self.timestamp = timestamp
		        self.energy_consumption = energy_consumption
		        self.energy_production = energy_production
		
		class Notification:
		    def __init__(self, id, user_id, device_id, notification_type, message, created_at, read_at=None):
		        self.id = id
		        self.user_id = user_id
		        self.device_id = device_id
		        self.notification_type = notification_type
		        self.message = message
		        self.created_at = created_at
		        self.read_at = read_at
		
		class NotificationThreshold:
		    def __init__(self, id, device_id, threshold_type, threshold_value, notification_frequency):
		        self.id = id
		        self.device_id = device_id
		        self.threshold_type = threshold_type
		        self.threshold_value = threshold_value
		        self.notification_frequency = notification_frequency
		
		class NotificationSetting:
		    def __init__(self, id, user_id, device_id, notification_type, enabled, frequency):
		        self.id = id
		        self.user_id = user_id
		        self.device_id = device_id
		        self.notification_type = notification_type
		        self.enabled = enabled
		        self.frequency = frequency
		
		class NotificationHistory:
		    def __init__(self, id, notification_id, user_id, device_id, sent_at, read_at=None):
		        self.id = id
		        self.notification_id = notification_id
		        self.user_id = user_id
		        self.device_id = device_id
		        self.sent_at = sent_at
		        self.read_at = read_at
	```
	
	**Step 3: Create a database connection class**
		*Create a Python class to connect to the MySQL database using a MySQL client library (e.g., `mysql-connector-python`).*
	```
		# Python class to connect to the MySQL database using a MySQL client library
		import mysql.connector
		
		class DatabaseConnection:
			def __init__(self, host, username, password, database):
				self.host = host
				self.username = username
				self.password = password
				self.database = database
				self.connection = None
				
			def connect(self):
				self.connection = mysql.connector.connect(
					host=self.host,
					user=self.username,
					password=self.password,
					database=self.database
				)
				
			def close(self):
				self.connection.close()
	```
	
	**Step 4: Implement CRUD operations**
		*Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for each table using the database connection class.*
		*For example, for the `User` class:*
	```
		class UserRepository:
		    def __init__(self, database_connection):
		        self.database_connection = database_connection
		        
		    def create(self, user):
		        cursor = self.database_connection.connection.cursor()
		        query = "INSERT INTO users (username, password, email) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)"
		        cursor.execute(query, (user.username, user.password, user.email))
		        self.database_connection.connection.commit()
		        cursor.close()
		        
		    def read(self, id):
		        cursor = self.database_connection.connection.cursor()
		        query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
		        cursor.execute(query, (id,))
		        result = cursor.fetchone()
		        cursor.close()
		        return User(*result)
		        
		    def update(self, user):
		        cursor = self.database_connection.connection.cursor()
		        query = "UPDATE users SET username = %s, password = %s, email = %s WHERE id = %s"
		        cursor.execute(query, (user.username, user.password, user.email, user.id))
		        self.database_connection.connection.commit()
		        cursor.close()
		        
		    def delete(self, id):
		        cursor = self.database_connection.connection.cursor()
		        query = "DELETE FROM users WHERE id = %s"
		        cursor.execute(query, (id,))
		        self.database_connection.connection.commit()
		        cursor.close()
	```
	
	**Step 5: Implement indexing and constraints**
		*Implement indexing and constraints to ensure data integrity and performance.*
		*For example, for the `User` table:*
	```
		class UserRepository:
		    def __init__(self, database_connection):
		        self.database_connection = database_connection
		
		    def create_index(self):
		        cursor = self.database_connection.connection.cursor()
		        query = "CREATE INDEX idx_username ON users (username)"
		        cursor.execute(query)
		        self.database_connection.connection.commit()
		        cursor.close()
		
		    def create_constraint(self):
		        cursor = self.database_connection.connection.cursor()
		        query = "ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT uk_username UNIQUE (username)"
		        cursor.execute(query)
		        self.database_connection.connection.commit()
		        cursor.close()
	```

	**Step 6: Implement data backup and recovery procedures**
		*Implement data backup and recovery procedures to ensure data safety and availability.*
		*For example, using `mysqldump` to backup the database:*
	```
		import subprocess
		
		class DatabaseBackup:
			def __init__(self, database_connection):
				self.database_connection = database_connection
		
			def backup(self, filename):
				command = f"mysqldump -h {self.database_connection.host} -u {self.database_connection.username} -p{self.database_connection.password} {self.database_connection.database} > {filename}"
				subprocess.run(command, shell=True)
	```

	**Step 7: Implement data security and access control**
		*Implement data security and access control measures to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.*
		*For example, using SSL/TLS encryption to secure the database connection:*
	```
		import mysql.connector
		
		class DatabaseConnection:
		    def __init__(self, host, username, password, database, ssl_ca, ssl_cert, ssl_key):
		        self.host = host
		        self.username = username
		        self.password = password
		        self.database = database
		        self.ssl_ca = ssl_ca
		        self.ssl_cert = ssl_cert
		        self.ssl_key = ssl_key
		        self.connection = None
		
		    def connect(self):
		        self.connection = mysql.connector.connect(
		            host=self.host,
		            user=self.username,
		            password=self.password,
		            database=self.database,
		            ssl_ca=self.ssl_ca,
		            ssl_cert=self.ssl_cert,
		            ssl_key=self.ssl_key
		        )
	```

# TASK 3

3. [ ] **Develop the device registration and management API** (High Priority)
    - Tool: Node.js with Express.js
    - Task: Develop a RESTful API to register and manage devices, including device information and authentication.
	
	**Here is a step-by-step guide on how to achieve device registration and management API using Python in OOP:**
	
	**Pseudo code**
	- Here is a pseudo code for the implementation:
	```
		# Step 1: Define the Device model
		Device = {
		    id: INTEGER,
		    name: STRING,
		    device_type: STRING,
		    location: STRING
		}
		
		# Step 2: Create a DeviceRepository
		DeviceRepository = {
		    register_device: FUNCTION(device),
		    get_device: FUNCTION(device_id),
		    update_device: FUNCTION(device_id, updates),
		    delete_device: FUNCTION(device_id)
		}
		
		# Step 3: Create a RESTful API using Flask
		FlaskAPI = {
		    register_device: FUNCTION(device_data),
		    get_device: FUNCTION(device_id),
		    update_device: FUNCTION(device_id, updates),
		    delete_device: FUNCTION(device_id)
		}
	```
	
	**Code Samples & Steps**
	
	**Step 1: Define the Device model**
		*Create a `Device` model to store device information:*

	- Create a `Device` model to store device information, including `id`, `name`, `type`, `location`, and any other relevant fields.
	- Consider using a library like Sequelize to interact with the database.
	```
		class Device:
		    def __init__(self, id, name, device_type, location):
		        self.id = id
		        self.name = name
		        self.device_type = device_type
		        self.location = location
		
		    def to_dict(self):
		        return {
		            'id': self.id,
		            'name': self.name,
		            'device_type': self.device_type,
		            'location': self.location
		        }
	```
	
	**Step 2: Create a DeviceRepository**
		*Create a `DeviceRepository` class to handle device registration and management:*
			
	- Create a `DeviceRepository` class to handle device registration and management, including methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting devices.
	- Consider using a repository pattern to abstract the data access layer.
	```
		class DeviceRepository:
		    def __init__(self):
		        self.devices = []  # list of Device objects
		
		    def register_device(self, device):
		        self.devices.append(device)
		        return device.to_dict()
		
		    def get_device(self, device_id):
		        for device in self.devices:
		            if device.id == device_id:
		                return device.to_dict()
		        return None
		
		    def update_device(self, device_id, updates):
		        for device in self.devices:
		            if device.id == device_id:
		                device.name = updates.get('name', device.name)
		                device.device_type = updates.get('device_type', device.device_type)
		                device.location = updates.get('location', device.location)
		                return device.to_dict()
		        return None
		
		    def delete_device(self, device_id):
		        for device in self.devices:
		            if device.id == device_id:
		                self.devices.remove(device)
		                return True
		        return False
	```
	
	**Step 3: Create a RESTful API using Flask**
		*Create a Flask API to handle device registration and management requests:*
		
	- Create an endpoint to register a new device, including validation and error handling.
	- Consider using a library like Joi to validate incoming requests.
	- Implement authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized users can register devices.
	
	> **Note**: Flask API can be used to build RESTful APIs, but it is not limited to that. It can also be used to build web applications with a more traditional, server-side rendered approach.

	```
		from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

# TASK 4

4. [ ] **Implement device data storage and processing** (High Priority)
	- Tool: MySQL with Sequelize
	- Task: Implement a scalable and efficient data storage solution to store device data, and develop data processing and analytics to provide insights on device data.
    
	To implement this task, you will need to:
	
	- Design a relational database schema using MySQL to store device data
	- Use Sequelize, a Node.js ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library, to interact with the MySQL database
	- Implement data storage and retrieval mechanisms to store and retrieve device data
	- Develop data processing and analytics to provide insights on device data, such as:
	    - Data aggregation and summarization
	    - Data filtering and sorting
	    - Data visualization (e.g. charts, graphs)
	    - Alert and notification systems based on device data thresholds
	    
	**Here is an example of how you might implement device data storage and processing using MySQL and Sequelize:**
	
	**Device Data Table**
	
	- `id` (primary key, auto-incrementing integer)
	- `device_id` (foreign key referencing the Devices table)
	- `data_type` (string, e.g. "energy_consumption", "temperature")
	- `data_value` (float or integer)
	- `timestamp` (datetime)
	
	**Sequelize Model**
	```
		const { Sequelize, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
		
		const sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', {
		  host: 'localhost',
		  dialect: 'ysql'
		});
		
		const DeviceData = sequelize.define('DeviceData', {
		  id: {
		    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
		    primaryKey: true,
		    autoIncrement: true
		  },
		  deviceId: {
		    type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
		    references: {
		      model: 'Devices',
		      key: 'id'
		    }
		  },
		  dataType: {
		    type: DataTypes.STRING
		  },
		  dataValue: {
		    type: DataTypes.FLOAT
		  },
		  timestamp: {
		    type: DataTypes.DATE
		  }
		});
		
		// Example of data storage and retrieval
		DeviceData.create({
		  deviceId: 1,
		  dataType: 'energy_consumption',
		  dataValue: 10.5,
		  timestamp: new Date()
		}).then(deviceData => {
		  console.log(deviceData);
		});
		
		DeviceData.findAll({
		  where: {
		    deviceId: 1,
		    dataType: 'energy_consumption'
		  }
		}).then(deviceData => {
		  console.log(deviceData);
		});
	```
	
	**Data Processing and Analytics**
	
	You can use various libraries and tools to perform data processing and analytics, such as:
	
	- Chart.js for data visualization
	- Moment.js for date and time manipulation
	- Lodash for data manipulation and filtering
	- Node.js built-in modules (e.g. `stats`, `math`) for statistical analysis
	
	For example, you might use Chart.js to create a line chart showing energy consumption over time:
	```
		const chart = new Chart(document.getElementById('chart'), {
		  type: 'line',
		  data: {
		    labels: [],
		    datasets: [{
		      label: 'Energy Consumption',
		      data: [],
		      backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
		      borderColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)',
		      borderWidth: 1
		    }]
		  },
		  options: {
		    scales: {
		      y: {
		        beginAtZero: true
		      }
		    }
		  }
		});
		
		DeviceData.findAll({
		  where: {
		    deviceId: 1,
		    dataType: 'energy_consumption'
		  },
		  order: [['timestamp', 'ASC']]
		}).then(deviceData => {
		  const labels = [];
		  const data = [];
		
		  deviceData.forEach(deviceData => {
		    labels.push(deviceData.timestamp);
		    data.push(deviceData.dataValue);
		  });
		
		  chart.data.labels = labels;
		  chart.data.datasets[0].data = data;
		  chart.update();
		});
	```
	
	###### **Here is a pseudo code for the guide:**
	```
		// Step 1: Set up MySQL and Sequelize
		const sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', {
		  host: 'localhost',
		  dialect: 'ysql'
		});
		
		const Device = sequelize.define('Device', {
		  id: {
		    type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
		    primaryKey: true,
		    autoIncrement: true
		  },
		  deviceId: {
		    type: Sequelize.STRING
		  },
		  deviceType: {
		    type: Sequelize.STRING
		  },
		  location: {
		    type: Sequelize.STRING
		  },
		  data: {
		    type: Sequelize.JSON
		  }
		});
		
		// Step 2: Implement Data Storage
		async function storeDeviceData(deviceId, deviceType, location, data) {
		  const device = await Device.create({
		    deviceId,
		    deviceType,
		    location,
		    data
		  });
		  console.log('Device data stored successfully');
		}
		
		// Step 3: Implement Data Processing and Analytics
		async function processDeviceData() {
		  const devices = await Device.findAll();
		  const processedData = devices.map(device => {
		    const data = device.data;
		    const averageValue = _.mean(data.map(d => d.value));
		    return {
		      deviceId: device.deviceId,
		      averageValue
		    };
		  });
		  console.log('Processed data:', processedData);
		}
		
		// Step 4: Implement Data Insights
		async function displayDeviceInsights() {
		  const devices = await Device.findAll();
		  const insights = devices.map(device => {
		    const data = device.data;
		    const maxValue = _.max(data.map(d => d.value));
		    const minValue = _.min(data.map(d => d.value));
		    return {
		      deviceId: device.deviceId,
		      maxValue,
		      minValue
		    };
		  });
		  console.log('Device insights:', insights);
		}
	```

	###### **Here is a step-by-step guide on how to achieve device data storage and processing using MySQL with Sequelize:**
	
	**Step 1: Set up MySQL and Sequelize**
	
	- Install MySQL and Sequelize using npm: `npm install mysql2 sequelize`
	- Create a new MySQL database and user for GreenNet
	- Create a Sequelize model for device data using the following schema:
	```
		const sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', {
		  host: 'localhost',
		  dialect: 'ysql'
		});
		
		const Device = sequelize.define('Device', {
		  id: {
		    type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
		    primaryKey: true,
		    autoIncrement: true
		  },
		  deviceId: {
		    type: Sequelize.STRING
		  },
		  deviceType: {
		    type: Sequelize.STRING
		  },
		  location: {
		    type: Sequelize.STRING
		  },
		  data: {
		    type: Sequelize.JSON
		  }
		});
	```
	
	**Step 2: Implement Data Storage**
	
	- Create a function to store device data in the MySQL database
	- Use Sequelize's `create` method to create a new device record
	- Use Sequelize's `update` method to update existing device data
	- Implement data validation and error handling using Sequelize's built-in validation and error handling mechanisms
	
	**Step 3: Implement Data Processing and Analytics**
	
	- Create a function to process and analyze device data
	- Use Sequelize's `findAll` method to retrieve device data from the database
	- Use a library like `lodash` to perform data aggregation and analysis
	- Implement data filtering, sorting, and grouping using Sequelize's `findAll` method
	- Use a library like `moment` to perform date and time-based analysis
	
	**Step 4: Implement Data Insights**
	
	- Create a function to generate data insights from processed device data
	- Use a library like `chart.js` or `d3.js` to create data visualizations
	- Implement data visualization components to display device data insights
	- Use Sequelize's `findAll` method to retrieve device data and display it on the dashboard
	
> Note that this is just one possible way to implement device data storage and processing using MySQL and Sequelize, and you may need to modify it based on the specific requirements of your application.

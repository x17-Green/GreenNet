### Establishing a Connection[](https://realpython.com/python-mysql/#establishing-a-connection "Permanent link")

The first step in interacting with a MySQL server is to establish a connection. To do this, you need [`connect()`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-api-mysql-connector-connect.html) from the `mysql.connector` module. This function takes in parameters like `host`, `user`, and `password` and returns a [`MySQLConnection`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-example-connecting.html) object. You can receive these credentials as input from the user and pass them to `connect()`:

```
from getpass import getpass
from mysql.connector import connect, Error

try:
    with connect(
        host="localhost",
        user=input("Enter username: "),
        password=getpass("Enter password: "),
    ) as connection:
        print(connection)
except Error as e:
    print(e)
```
> The code above uses the entered login credentials to establish a connection with your MySQL server.

There are several important things to notice in the code above:

- You should always deal with the [exceptions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-api-errors.html) that might be raised while establishing a connection to the MySQL server. This is why you use a [`try` … `except`](https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/) block to catch and print any exceptions that you might encounter.
    
- You should always close the connection after you’re done accessing the database. Leaving unused open connections can lead to several unexpected errors and performance issues. The above code takes advantage of a [context manager using `with`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iba-I4CrmyA), which abstracts away the connection cleanup process.
    
- You should _never hard-code your login credentials_, that is, your username and password, directly in a Python script. This is a bad practice for deployment and poses [a serious security threat](https://qz.com/674520/companies-are-sharing-their-secret-access-codes-on-github-and-they-may-not-even-know-it/). The code above prompts the user for login credentials. It uses the built-in [`getpass`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/getpass.html) module to hide the password. While this is better than hard-coding, there are other, more secure ways to store sensitive information, like using [environment variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iWhQWVXosU).


## How to rename a database
> Be careful when renaming a database, as it can cause issues with existing applications or scripts that rely on the original database name. It's always a good idea to create a backup of your database before making any significant changes.

> The `RENAME DATABASE` statement is not a valid SQL command in MariaDB.

Instead, you can use the following method to rename a database in MariaDB:

#### Dump and restore with a new name

You can dump the entire database, and then restore it with a new name. Here's an example:

```
mysqldump -u green -proot greennetdb > greennetdb.sql
mysql -u green -proot -e "CREATE DATABASE greennet_db;"
mysql -u green -proot greennet_db < greennetdb.sql
```

This will create a new database `greennet_db` and import all the data from the original `greennetdb` database.


## How to delete a database
To delete a MariaDB database, you can use the `DROP DATABASE` command. Here's an example:

```
DROP DATABASE <db_name>;
```

Replace `<db_name>` with the name of the database you want to delete.
